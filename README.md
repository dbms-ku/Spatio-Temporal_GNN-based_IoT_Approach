## Overview
The graph neural network can be used for predicting the water quality case. The approach is suitable for water surface case, such as rivers, lakes, and non-man-made environmental (non-water distribution networks)

## Keypoint
a. Dataset: the public dataset from https://gemstat.org/
b. Edge construction consist of two which Minimum Spanning Tree and K-NN
c. We use graph convolutional network for model training for 80:20 split

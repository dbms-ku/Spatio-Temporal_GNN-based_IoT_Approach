## Overview
The graph neural network can be used for predicting the water quality case. The approach is suitable for water surface case, such as rivers, lakes, and non-man-made environmental (non-water distribution networks).

## Keypoint
-  Dataset: the public dataset from https://gemstat.org/
-  Edge construction consist of two approaches which are Minimum Spanning Tree and K-NN
-  We use graph convolutional network for model training for 80:20 split
